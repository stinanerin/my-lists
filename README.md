# Shopping Lists

## Summary - Frontend project 2023
Group work in agile project methodology, where we acted as clients & designers for a weather application developed by one team, and as developers for a shopping list application designed by another team.

We worked with dynamic programming, Local Storage, JSON, API, and asynchronous code execution. The application is built mobile-first but also works well on desktop. Local Storage is used to simulate a login and allow a user to save their lists, which are stored in an API.

## Individual responsibility
I(StinaðŸ˜Š) was responsible for the login, logout, and registration functionality, including the validation of it - which yes, the code can be improved!

I was also responsible for creating the product bar(which we called rec bar) and it's functionality. The big crux was figuring out how to make sure the clicked item was added to the correct list. Additionally, I created the functionality to increase and decrease the qty of each item, deleting an item if the qty reaches zero. 

Finally, I used some somewhat repetetive if-statements to add the functionality of automatically combining the quantity of an item when moved to a list that already has a duplicate. See below.

It was an incredibly challenging project, knowing nothing about API:s before - but all the more rewarding in the end!

I will certainly keep improving the code as a stoamch flu kept me from doing all the features I wanted.

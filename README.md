# Shopping Lists

## Summary - Frontend project 2023
Group work in an agile project methodology, where we acted as clients & designers for a weather application developed by one team and as developers for a shopping list application designed by another team. 

The clients idea was to develop a shopping list with a fixed product range - think of it like a shopping list for ICA or Coop, with just the products they offer in the store to add to your shopping list.

We worked with dynamic programming, Local Storage, JSON, API, and asynchronous code execution. The application is built mobile-first but also works well on the desktop. Local Storage is used to simulate a login and allow a user to save their lists, which are stored in an API.

## Individual responsibility
I (Stina ðŸ˜Š) was responsible for the login, logout, and registration functionality, including the validation of it - which yes, the code can certainly be improved! I also created the feature for the current logged-in user's list to be stored with their user. This allows the user's lists to be automatically rendered when they log back in after ending their session.

I was also responsible for creating the product bar (which we called rec bar) and its functionality. The big crux was figuring out how to make sure the clicked item was added to the correct list. Additionally, I created the functionality to increase and decrease the quantity of each item, deleting an item if the quantity reaches zero.

Finally, I used some somewhat repetitive if-statements to add the functionality of automatically combining the quantity of an item when moved to a list that already has a duplicate. See below.

It was an incredibly challenging project, knowing nothing about APIs before - but all the more rewarding in the end!

I will certainly keep improving the code as a stomach flu kept me from doing all the features we planned to have the time to do! Most notably having mixed data flows.
